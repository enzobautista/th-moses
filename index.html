	<span class="intros">I was born on 1391 BC in the land of Goshen. My parents are Amram and Jochebed. I have two siblings, Aaron and Miriam. <br><br><br>

	When Pharaoh was threatened by the large population of my people, the Israelites, he ordered that all the new born male children be drowned into the Nile. I was saved by Pharaoh's daughter when she found me floating in a waterproof basket. She took me and named me "Moses," meaning "drawn from the water. <br><br><br>
	I was raised in the splendor of the Egyptian court as the adopted son of Pharaoh's daughter. As I grew, I was still aware of my Hebraic roots--giving me a sense of compassion for my people. </span>

	<span class="intros">My life suddenly took a big turn when I witnessed an Egyptian brutally assaulting a Hebrew slave. I...accidentally killed the Egyptian. Afraid of Pharaoh's wrath, I fled to the desert of Midian. <br><br><br>
	There I met Jethro, a Midianite priest. I fell in love with his daughter Zipporah. Soon Zipporah and I got married. <br><br><br>
	I was up in the Horeb mountain tending my flock, when I saw a curious sight. It was a burning bush that kept on burning, without turning into ash. <br><br><br>
	I approached the burning bush and God spoke to me. He commissioned me to lead his people out of oppression. Initially I resisted his call, but I eventually accepted it. Aaron and I set out to convince our people of God's plan. However, as we failed to convince the Pharaoh, the oppression of our people only worsened.<br><br><br>
	However I know that God is with us and that with Him, oppression of any sort will stop.</span>
